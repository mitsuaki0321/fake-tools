3. Select the target components and click the third button. The target components will be remembered.
4. Use the spin box or slider to blend and adjust the weights from the source to the target. Alternatively, use the rightmost button to paste the source weights directly to the target.

**Copying between selected components one-to-one**

2. Select the source component and click the second button. The source component will be remembered.
3. Select the same number of target components as the source and click the third button. The target components will be remembered.
